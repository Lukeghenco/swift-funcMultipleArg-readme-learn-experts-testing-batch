## Learning Objectives

* Explain that a function is a self-contained chunk of code that performs a specific task. A function should do one thing and one thing well.
* Explain that a function has a name that identifies what it does, and that name is used to "call" the function to perform its task when needed.
* Create functions that contain multiple arguments


## Functions and Arguments

In the last lesson, you learned how to create your own functions to keep self-contained chunks of code in one place, and call them as often as you want. You even learned how to create a function that takes an argument, so you can generalize its behavior a bit. Hopefully you saw how useful functions can be when writing code in Swift, but now you're about to see how they can be even _more_ useful.

Let's start, though, by reviewing how you create functions.

Here's your goal: Write a function that will print the string "There are &lt;number&gt; moons orbiting &lt;planet&gt;." This will let you show off to our friend Neil DeGrasse Tyson how much you know about astronomy, _and_ write some Swift code in the meantime. Start by proving how much you know about Jupiter (hint: Jupiter has _67_ moons).

What's the simplest way to write your function?

A simple way to write a function to print "There are 67 moons orbiting Jupiter." would be this:

```swift
func moonsOfJupiter() {
    print("There are 67 moons orbiting Jupiter.")
}
```

Take a moment to remember how you write functions in Swift. Functions are introduced using the `func` keyword. Then, you write the name of the function—in this case, `moonsOfJupiter` (remember, function names can't contain spaces!). Next comes the argument list in parentheses. In this case, `moonsOfJupiter` doesn't take any arguments, so you just write an empty set of parentheses. Then you write the body of the function—the statements that will be executed when the function is called—between curly braces.

Easy, right?

Go ahead and write your function in your playground file. Don't forget to call it! Remember that you call a function by writing a statement consisting of the name of the function and parentheses:

```swift
moonsOfJupiter()
```

Do you see "There are 67 moons orbiting Jupiter." in your playground's console? You should!

### Arguments

Of course, this function isn't very general. You want to be able to print the number of moons that _any_ planet takes, right? Remember that you learned that functions can take arguments, so let's make the name of the planet an argument. Do you remember how to do that? It's easy: Just add the argument name to the set of parentheses you write after the function name. Don't forget the type of the argument! Since you're accepting the name of the planet as an argument, the argument should be a `String`.

Here's a function definition that takes the name of the planet as an argument. Since we're allowing any planet name to be passed, let's name the function `planetDescription`. Go ahead and add this to your playground file.

```swift
func planetDescription(planet: String) {
    print("There are 67 moons orbiting \(planet).")
}
```

Do you remember how to call a function with an argument? Go ahead and try calling `planetDescription` in your playground file. If you need help, here's how you call a function that takes an argument:

```swift
planetDescription("Jupiter")
```

Do you see "There are 67 moons orbiting Jupiter." printed to your console? Excellent!

But wait...

What happens when you call `planetDescription` with "Mars" as an argument?

```swift
var planet = "Mars"
planetDescription(planet)
```

Did you see "There are 67 moons orbiting Mars." in your console?

Something's wrong here! There are only two planets orbiting Mars. If you tell Neil DeGrasse Tyson that there are 67 moons orbiting Mars, he won't be impressed at all! You need to fix this, before he can see your program!

## Functions and Multiple Arguments

You've probably realized the problem by now: In order for your function to work, it needs to take _two_ arguments, not just one. The planet name alone won't cut it—you need to be able to pass in the number of moons, too.

Swift functions can take more than one argument. Remember when you declared the argument to `planetDescription`? You can specify more than one argument in that argument list. You can specify multiple arguments by placing them in parentheses, separated by commas, using the same name-type pattern you used for single arguments. Take a look at this in action:

```swift
func greet(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}
```

Notice that in the body of the function, arguments are still referred to by the name you specify in the argument list, even when you specify more than one. Easy!

Now that you know how to specify multiple arguments, how can you adapt `planetDescription()` to take both a planet name and its number of moons? Try it out in your playground!

In case you got stuck, here's what `planetDescription()` should look like now:

```swift
func planetDescription(planet: String, numberOfMoons: Int) {
    print("There are \(numberOfMoons) moons orbiting \(planet)")
}
```

Great! Now, how do you call that function?

Since `planetDescription` now takes more than one argument, you have to specify _all_ the arguments when calling the function. If you only specify one, you will get an error. Give it a try! Swift will report an error if you only call `planetDescription` with one argument:

```swift
planetDescription("Jupiter")  // This is an error!
```

Since you specify multiple arguments using a comma-separated list, you may be tempted to call `planetDescription` with multiple arguments, like this:

```swift
planetDescription("Jupiter", 67)
```

Try that in your playground file. It won't work! This shows one of the oddities of Swift: When calling a function with multiple arguments, you have to specify the name of the argument for the second (and subsequent) arguments, using the same name specified in the function definition. It looks a little weird, but you call `planetDescription` like this:

```swift
planetDescription("Jupiter", numberOfMoons: 67)
```

See how the second argument is named? `numberOfMoons` is the same name used in the function definition.

Try calling `planetDescription` in different ways. Recall that you can pass variables into a function when you call it—even if the function takes more than one argument. Try impressing Neil DeGrasse Tyson with your knowledge of our solar system! Here's how you can call a function with multiple arguments using variables:

```swift
var planet = "Jupiter"
var moons = 67
planetDescription(planet, numberOfMoons: moons)
// prints "There are 67 moons orbiting Jupiter"

planet = "Mars"
moons = 2
planetDescription(planet, numberOfMoons: moons)
// prints "There are 2 moons orbiting Mars"
```

Now that's impressive! Play around with functions that take multiple arguments a while until you are really comfortable with them. There are six more planets in our solar system that you can use in your own examples!
